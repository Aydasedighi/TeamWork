      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        The zombies, referred to as "walkers", shamble towards living humans and
        other creatures to eat them; they are attracted to noise, such as
        gunshots, and to different scents. Although it initially seems that only
        humans that are bitten or scratched by walkers can turn into other
        walkers, it is revealed early in the series that all living humans carry
        the pathogen responsible for the mutation. The mutation is activated
        after the death of the pathogen's host, and the only way to permanently
        kill a walker is to damage its brain or destroy the body entirely, such
        as by cremating it.
